### Solution
IPJ 1.1.6
### Notes

1. Notice how you can create _usage messages_ to alert the comman-line user that they didn't include the expected number of command-line arguments.
2. Notice the deep directory hierarchy for the `UseThree` class. In Java, classes are organized in an elaborate package hierarchy. You can read about the naming conventions [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html).
3. For classes created in our course I have adopted the following java package `edu.msud.cs.cs1`. So, the full name of `UseThree` is `edu.msud.cs.cs1.UseThree`.
4. If you are unning this project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can specify the arguments in the _Program arguments_ slot in *Run | Edit Configurations...*.
5. If you want to run this project from the command line, you need to do so in the project directory `out/production/usethree/edu/msud/cs/cs1/`.
