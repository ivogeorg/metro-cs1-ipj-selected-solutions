### Guidance
IPJ 2.2.23

### Notes

1. This should be straightforward. Feel free to use the solutions for each of the functions that you have seen so far in IPJ, or elsewhere.
2. Note that _overloaded_ methods are methods that have the same name (and usually identical opeartions) but work on different data types. In this case, you should have two sets of all methods, the first one working on `int` and the second on `long`.
3. For the testing, pick 10-15 use cases to test your methods over. Putting them in `main` is fine.
4. For the solutions to exercises mentioned in the exercise wording, pick 3-4 exercises from IPJ so far that you think your new library is suitable for, and apply the library methods to solving them. Putting them in `main` is fine.
5. _Optional: If you are familiar with the unit-testing library `JUnit`, the best way to write these tests is using it. There are some instructions on how to do that in the solution for [IPJ 1.2.8](homework-solutions/quadratic)._
